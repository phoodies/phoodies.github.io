                For our dear customers, please avoid abruptly canceling your orders as we will tag you as 'Bogus'.   Please avoid scamming our clients & riders. They also need income & extra income. I hope you fully understand that.   Lastly, please know that there bill seeking to prohibit the cancellation of confirmed orders when the items are already in the possession of the delivery rider or in transit to the customer has been filed -'Bogus' & 'cancellation' (House Bill (HB). 6958 or the Food & Grocery Delivery Services Protection Act)  where you could be incarcerated & pay damages.  Thank you so much & have a great day.
